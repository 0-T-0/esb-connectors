		1. Use the given test account and parameters. - in this scenario you only need to replace apiUrl, accessToken and user in property file
		2. Setup new concur account and follow all the instruction given below
	
Steps to follow in setting integration test.
 1.  Download ESB 4.8.1 from official website.
 2.  Deploy following patches.
            special-char-on-get

			PATCH for XSLT with local entry
 3.  Navigate to location "/wso2esb-4.8.1/repository/conf/axis2" and add/uncomment following lines in "axis2.xml" and Message Formatters and Message Builders should be added for each of the content types of the files to be added as attachments.
		
		Message Formatters :-
		
        <messageFormatter contentType="image/gif" class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.ExpandingMessageFormatter"/>
        <messageFormatter contentType="img/gif" class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.ExpandingMessageFormatter"/>
        <messageFormatter contentType="image/jpeg" class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.ExpandingMessageFormatter"/>
        <messageFormatter contentType="image/png" class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.ExpandingMessageFormatter"/>
		
		Message Builders :-
		
		<messageBuilder contentType="image/gif" class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.BinaryRelayBuilder"/>

        <messageBuilder contentType="image/jpeg" class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.BinaryRelayBuilder"/>
        <messageBuilder contentType="image/png" class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.BinaryRelayBuilder"/>
			
 4.  Compress modified ESB as wso2esb-4.8.1.zip and copy that zip file in to location "Integration_Test/products/esb/4.8.1/modules/distribution/target/".

 5.  Make sure "integration-base" project is placed at "Integration_Test/products/esb/4.8.1/modules/integration/"

 6.  Navigate to "Integration_Test/products/esb/4.8.1/modules/integration/integration-base" and run the following command.
      $ mvn clean install
      
 7.  Add following dependency to the file "Integration_Test/products/esb/4.8.1/modules/integration/connectors/pom.xml"
 
		 <dependency>
			 <groupId>org.wso2.esb</groupId>
			 <artifactId>org.wso2.connector.integration.test.base</artifactId>
			 <version>4.8.1</version>
			 <scope>system</scope>
			 <systemPath>${basedir}/../integration-base/target/org.wso2.connector.integration.test.base-4.8.1.jar</systemPath>
		 </dependency>
  
 8.  Copy the src directory "concur/org.wso2.carbon.connector/src/" to location "Integration_Test/products/esb/4.8.1/modules/integration/connectors/"
        
 9.  Prerequisites for Concur Connector Integration Testing

     Follow these steps before start testing.
	 
     a)  Create a fresh account in Concur using the URL https://developer.concur.com/register with the web browser.
     b)  Concur automatically creates a basic partner application and gives you a Welcome page includes the following information:

     g)  Create a New Expense Report by giving appropriate data into required fields.
	 h)	 Generate New Access Token using OAuth web flow using bellow steps:
	 
			1) Use following redirection URL format to retrieve OAuth code using web browser.
			
				https://www.concursolutions.com/net2/oauth2/Login.aspx?client_id=(YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY)&scope=ATTEND,CONFIG,EXPRPT,EXTRCT,IMAGE,ITINER,LIST,MTNG,PAYBAT,TRVPRF,TRVREQ,TWS,USER&redirect_uri=https://www.google.lk/
				
				Note: Use the Consumer Key returned from step (b) for client_id URL parameter.
			
			2) This gives OAuth Confirmation page is where the user grants the partner application access to the userâ€™s data and Click Allow.
			3) Use following redirection URL format to retrieve Access Token using web browser.
			
				https://www.concursolutions.com/net2/oauth2/GetAccessToken.ashx?code=(OAuth_CODE)&client_id=(YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY)&client_secret=(YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET)
				
				Note: Use OAuth Code returned from above step (1) for code URL parameter. Use the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret returned from step (b)

		6) vendorDescription - The descriptive text of the vendor for create a quick expense entry. Maximum Length is 64.
		7) updatedVendorDescription - The descriptive text of the vendor for update a quick expense entry. Maximum Length is 64.
